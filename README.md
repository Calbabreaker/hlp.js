# The Helper Utils Library
Welcome to The Helper Utils Library where there is bunch of useful tools.
You will see different sections for the different parts to the library.

### Notes: 
* The source code is in the src/ directory and all the paths are in src/paths.xtx
* The library code you probaly want to use is in the lib/ directory with helperutils.js and helperutils.min.js (minified version)

## Core
PATH: src/core.js
This is where the helper class lives. 

## Dictionary
PATH: src/dictionary.js
I know that you can make dictionaries by creating objects but there are no helper functions to go along with it.
So I made a dictionary class.

## Matrix
PATH: src/matrix.js
Useful for doing matrix stuff like neural networks.
